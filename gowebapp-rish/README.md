This is my university project, created from the golang "Writing web applications" tutorial https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/
I haven't used "Make handler" function, and also regexp, to make the program easier to understand



The main goal is to comprehend the code.
additional changes that I have made:
1. New directories for templates and new pages.
2. Created a folder for .CSS to create the navbar (and also did set the directory in main.go)
3. Adaptive navbar (The main task is to make it without using JS)

Future TODO list is:
1. to make it possible to upload your own picture to a page what you are creating now
2. Connect mysql or postgresql to save your pages (and perhaps images)


Also mysql-go is a completely different project, what I'm looking forward to make It separated from the repository (because code there is completely different and doesn't have any similarities with the master branch)
